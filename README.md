Voyage for Valhalla is a python terminal game which runs on a web browser CLI hosted through Heroku.
The aim of the game is for the player to guess the random word that is generated by one of the python functions. The user has 5 lives, of which one is lost with every wrong answer. 

Here is the live version of my project:

https://pp3.herokuapp.com/


## How to play

The game generates a random word and each letter of said word you need to guess is marked by an underscore, so the user knows how many letter they have to guess. If they guess a correct letter, a life is not deducted. The correctly guessed letter replaces the underscore that denotes it so the user can start to guess the word. If the user gets a wrong letter, it will deduct a life and the boat (ASCII) will start to sink. If the user guesses a letter they have already guessed (within their current game) they will be notified to try again and a life will not be deducted. If the user runs out of lives, the boat will sink and the game will start again should they choose. If they guess the word within their lives, the boat will not sink and they will win the game. 

## Existing features

* Intro screen and intructions. The game welcomes you with the ASCII boat that you will be trying to save. Alongside are the instructions on how to play the game. Underneath is an input field that requires you to enter your name to begin.

* Once the user name is entered, a random word is generated and each letter is denoted by an underscore. The code here displays the lives the user has (this starts at 5). It displays the current word and therefore the current amount of letters the user needs to guess. The code is personalised with an F string so that the game addresses the player by the name they entered and encourages them to enter a letter.

* If a correct letter is guessed, the game will congratulate you and ask you to guess another letter. In this instance because the guess was correct, a life is not deducted.

* If a wrong letter is guessed, the game will throw a code that this letter is not in the word and a life is also deducted. The ASCII image of the boat will also appear to start sinking as code is initialised to remove it from the original image. The more you lose the more the boat sinks!

* If a duplicate letter is guessed, then a warning will throw that the user has already guessed this letter. In this instance, a life will not be deducted as it was not a wrong answer.

* If the user inputs anything that is not a letter i.e number or special character etc, then it throws a warning that it is not a valid response and asks the user to try again.

* If the user runs out of lives, the boat sinks. The game gives you the option to hit a key to begin again, which takes the player back to the start of the game.

# Future features

* A more appropriate ASCII boat for the game in a build environment that supports the unicode necessary:

# Technologies used

* Python

# Data model

* Array of strings used for words list.

* The while loop stores guesses in the user_guess variable. It is also used in the validation for defensive programming.

* Print method throughout to let user know if they are winning, losing, playing the game correctly with the correct inputs.


# Testing

I have tested my code using the following:

* https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/ CI python lint validator and all the code came up with zero issues:

* Testing also included using invalid inputs and duplicate inputs to make sure that the counter for lives works and that the warning strings appear if the user is accidentally inputting the same letter twice or accidentally submitting an invalid response such as a number.
* It has also been tested in my local terminal and the heroku terminal.

# Bugs

Solved:

* During the construction of this project I mostly used the terminal to identify bugs as it logged errors if my code was not correct. Below is an example of a variable that I had placed in the wrong section of my code and so it was coming up as not defined. I placed it into my main function as an empty array and it solved the problem.

* The VScoder also helped me solve bugs with suggestions. Below is an example of too many characters in a line of code:

Unsolved:

* No bugs remaining

# Deployment

This project was deployed via the Code Institute's mock terminal on the Heroku platform:

https://pp3.herokuapp.com/

Steps:

* Created app in heroku
* Added config val for port 8000
* Linked github repository
* Deployed manually
