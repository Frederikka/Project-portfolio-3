# Project Background

Voyage to Valhalla is a python terminal game which runs on a web browser CLI hosted through Heroku.
The aim of the game is for the player to guess the random word that is generated by one of the python functions. The user has 5 lives, of which one is lost with every wrong answer. 

Here is the live version of my project: https://pp3.herokuapp.com/

# User Stories

- **User/player goals**

  - Be able to play a game of hangman.
  - Be able to enter their name.
  - Be able to guess a letter.
  - Be able to get a correct guess.
  - Be able to get an incorrect guess.
  - Be able to sink the ship with incorrect answers.
  - Be able to restart the game.


- **Creator/Owner goals**

  - Present own game in understandable manner.
  - Instructions to be intuitive.
  - Handle possible invalid inputs from players.
  - Track the correct/incorrect answers.



## How to play

The game generates a random word and each letter of said word you need to guess is marked by an underscore, so the user knows how many letter they have to guess. If they guess a correct letter, a life is not deducted. The correctly guessed letter replaces the underscore that denotes it so the user can start to guess the word. If the user gets a wrong letter, it will deduct a life and the boat (ASCII) will start to sink. If the user guesses a letter they have already guessed (within their current game) they will be notified to try again and a life will not be deducted. If the user runs out of lives, the boat will sink and the game will start again should they choose. If they guess the word within their lives, the boat will not sink and they will win the game. 

## Existing features

* Intro screen and intructions. The game welcomes you with the ASCII boat that you will be trying to save. Alongside are the instructions on how to play the game. Underneath is an input field that requires you to enter your name to begin.

* Once the user name is entered, a random word is generated and each letter is denoted by an underscore. The code here displays the lives the user has (this starts at 5). It displays the current word and therefore the current amount of letters the user needs to guess. The code is personalised with an F string so that the game addresses the player by the name they entered and encourages them to enter a letter.

* If a correct letter is guessed, the game will congratulate you and ask you to guess another letter. In this instance because the guess was correct, a life is not deducted.

* If a wrong letter is guessed, the game will throw a code that this letter is not in the word and a life is also deducted. The ASCII image of the boat will also appear to start sinking as code is initialised to remove it from the original image. The more you lose the more the boat sinks!

* If a duplicate letter is guessed, then a warning will throw that the user has already guessed this letter. In this instance, a life will not be deducted as it was not a wrong answer.

* If the user inputs anything that is not a letter i.e number or special character etc, then it throws a warning that it is not a valid response and asks the user to try again.

* If the user runs out of lives, the boat sinks. The game gives you the option to hit a key to begin again, which takes the player back to the start of the game.

# Future features


* A more appropriate ASCII boat for the game in a build environment that supports the unicode necessary:

# Technologies used

* Python

# Libraries and modules

* The Python import random module was used to select a random word for the game.
* The unittest library was used for the testing file.

# Testing

I have tested my code using the following:

Unittest:

![image](https://github.com/Frederikka/Django-blog/assets/104646542/b3e86953-bbe6-418e-bc78-f577b86ea3c9)

All tests have returned as passing:

## PEP8 Validation

* https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/ CI python lint validator and all the code came up with zero issues:

![image](https://github.com/Frederikka/Django-blog/assets/104646542/9393e397-eced-42f8-9806-5b82ab9c6bd2)

* Testing validation:

* Testing also included using invalid inputs and duplicate inputs to make sure that the counter for lives works and that the warning strings appear if the user is accidentally inputting the same letter twice or accidentally submitting an invalid response such as a number.
* It has also been tested in my local terminal and the heroku terminal.

## Error Handling

- Invalid user inputs are handled gracefully and a feedback message is shown to users on invalid input submission.
- This includes:
    - Only accepting alphabetical characters for name entries.
    - Only accepting alphabetical characters for letter guesses.
    - Providing an error message if user has guessed same letter twice.


# Bugs

Solved:

* During the construction of this project I mostly used the terminal to identify bugs as it logged errors if my code was not correct. Below is an example of a variable that I had placed in the wrong section of my code and so it was coming up as not defined. I placed it into my main function as an empty array and it solved the problem.

* The VScoder also helped me solve bugs with suggestions. Below is an example of too many characters in a line of code:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104646542/231228023-1bee0e4f-17e0-429b-b5ee-b92688fe1214.png)

There was a bug wherein you could submit special characters as player's name:

![image](https://github.com/Frederikka/Django-blog/assets/104646542/017a87db-c41d-4ebb-8656-6357a885bd50)

This was fixed by using an is.alpha method so that only alpabetical characters can be submitted for names.


# Deployment

This project was deployed via the Code Institute's mock terminal on the Heroku platform.
The following git commands were used throughout development to push code to the remote repo:

git add - This command was used to add the file(s) to the staging area before they are committed.

git commit -m “commit message” - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository queue ready for the final step.

git push - This command was used to push all committed code to the remote repository on github.


## Deployment Steps

Steps:

* Created app in heroku
* Added config val for port 8000
* Linked github repository
* Deployed manually

<details>
<summary>Cloning the Repo</summary>

1. Click on the "Code" button near the top right corner of the page.
2. Copy the HTTPS or SSH URL that appears in the box.
Open your terminal (or Git Bash on Windows) and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
3. Type "git clone" followed by a space, and then paste the URL you copied in step 3.
4. Press enter to run the command. This will clone the repository onto your local machine.
5. You should now have a local copy of the GitHub repository on your machine.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Forking the Repo</summary>

1. Click the "Fork" button near the top right corner of the page. This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.
2. Once the fork is complete, you will be redirected to the forked repository in your account.
3. If you haven't already, clone the forked repository to your local machine using the steps outlined in the previous answer.
4. Make any changes or additions you want to the code in your local copy of the repository.
5. Commit your changes to your local repository using the "git commit" command.
6. Push your changes to the forked repository on GitHub using the "git push" command.
7. If you want to contribute your changes back to the original repository, create a pull request by going to the original repository's page and clicking the "New pull request" button. From there, you can compare your changes to the original repository and request that they be merged.
8. You should now have a forked copy of the GitHub repository in your account, and you can make changes to it and contribute back to the original repository if desired.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Deployment to Heroku</summary>

Note: A Heroku account is required for deployment to Heroku.

1. From the Dashboard, click "New" - "Create new app".

2. Enter a name for the app. Click "Create App".

![Step 2](/assets/readme/img/heroku-deployment-2.png "Step 2")

3. Connect your GitHub account and select the repository and branch to deploy.

![Step 3](/assets/readme/img/heroku-deployment-3.png "Step 3")

4. When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the Settings tab. The ordering is as follows:
    - heroku/python
    - heroku/nodejs

    ![Step 4](/assets/readme/img/heroku-deployment-4.png "Step 4")

5. You must then create a Config Var called PORT. Set this to 8000.
